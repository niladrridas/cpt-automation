CPT Automation is a futuristic Python library designed to automate tasks in Cisco Packet Tracer simulation environments, empowering users with advanced capabilities for network configuration and management.

## Features ‚ú®

- Automate network topology setup and configuration.
- Perform batch operations on network devices.
- Simulate network events and troubleshoot issues.
- Integrate with external systems for enhanced functionality.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

You can install the library via pip:

```
pip install cpt-automation
```

## Usage üöÄ

```
import cpt_automation

# Example 1: Create a basic network topology
network = cpt_automation.Network()
router = network.add_router("Router1")
switch = network.add_switch("Switch1")
pc1 = network.add_pc("PC1")
pc2 = network.add_pc("PC2")

# Connect devices
network.connect(router, switch)
network.connect(switch, pc1)
network.connect(switch, pc2)

# Example 2: Configure devices
router.set_ip_address("192.168.1.1")
pc1.set_ip_address("192.168.1.2")
pc2.set_ip_address("192.168.1.3")

# Example 3: Simulate network event
pc1.ping(pc2.ip_address)

# Example 4: Save and load network configurations
network.save("network_config.json")
network.load("network_config.json")
```
